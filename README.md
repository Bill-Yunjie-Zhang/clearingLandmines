## Beginner Guide:
1. Since Windows system doesn't have "Clearing land mines", one of my favorite games for killing time build in now, this is a travesty of mine build using React app.

## Manual:
1. Left click to step onto the picked spot
2. Right click to neutralize and mark a land mine (for mobiles or touch screens, long click)
3. Click on already opened spot to open all of the surronding unneutralized area


## Rules:
1. If you step onto a mine land mine, you lose
2. If you marked a mine incorrectly, you lose
3. Finish marking everything, you win
